A good thriller doesn’t announce itself with noise. It creeps in quietly, tightens its grip scene by scene, 
and keeps your mind racing long after the scene leaves the screen. It’s the kind of film that makes you lean forward, 
second-guess your instincts and play detective in your head. Bejoy Nambiar’s Tu Yaa Main understands this instinct well.
 It wants you alert, uneasy and constantly asking, “Did that really just happen?”
 throughout the course of the movie.     
A remake of the 2018 Thai film, The Pool, Tu Yaa Main places its story firmly in today’s world, where clout matters, 
attention is currency and survival is not always about strength but choice. Set largely in Mumbai and driven by Gen-Z energy,
 the film stars Adarsh Gourav and Shanaya Kapoor in a pairing that feels surprisingly natural. 
 What begins as a modern romance slowly slips into something far darker and far more unsettling...
 but treads a more adventurous route.

Shanaya Kapoor plays Avani Shah aka Miss Vanity, a social media influencer who lives life through a phone screen 
and thrives on visibility. Adarsh Gourav is Maruti Kadam aka Ala Flowpara, a rapper from Nala Sopara, chasing a dream 
that feels just out of reach...on paper. They come from very different worlds, yet they are drawn to each other by ambition, 
curiosity and a need to be understood and viral. Their meeting is rooted in collaboration, but the film smartly allows space 
for emotions to develop without rushing into dramatic declarations.

A planned trip to Goa changes everything. Circumstances go wrong, plans fall apart, and Avani and Maruti are forced to
 stop at a remote hotel. From here, the film quietly shifts gears. What once felt like a breezy road story turns into 
 a nervewracking survival drama. Danger doesn’t announce itself immediately, but when it does, it is brutal and relentless. 
 The crocodile threat, which could have easily slipped into campy territory, is handled with surprising restraint.

What works early on is the ease of the storytelling. Nambiar doesn’t overdo the glamour of online fame, nor does he romanticise 
struggle. Avani’s polished life and Maruti’s modest reality are shown side by side, letting the contrast speak for itself. 
There is warmth here, and even humour, as the two explore each other’s spaces and boundaries. It feels lived-in and believable, 
which is crucial for what comes later.
